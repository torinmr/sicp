This is my attempt to work through all of the classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I'm using a beautiful edition I purchased [here](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462740318&sr=8-1&keywords=sicp).

I'm aiming to do all of the exercises, though I am skipping a few which are purely mathematical with no programming component or relation to programming. (E.g. 1.13, which asks to prove the connection between Fibonnaci numbers and the golden ratio.)

Besides putting my answers to the exercises here, I'm also following along with the [SICP Solution Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions), checking my work and adding alternate solutions and corrections there where appropriate.
