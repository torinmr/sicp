Let's consider the case where we have a message which contains (2^n - 1) symbols
from an alphabet of n distinct symbols, with the symbols having the relative
frequency described in 71 (i.e. the

The encode procedure makes one call to encode-symbol for each symbol in the
message. Besides this call, all operations take constant time except for the
append operation, which takes time proportional to the number of bits in the
representation of the symbol being considered. Thus, the total time spent in
encode, not including encode-symbol, is:

O(n*1 + n*2 + (n-1)*4 + ... + 1*2^(n-1)) = O(2^n)

Now, let's analyze a call to encode-symbol, for the ith symbol (the one with
frequency 2^(i-1)). encode-symbol is called once for each level of the tree
traversed, for a total of (i+1) calls if i < n, or i calls if i == n. In each
call on a non-leaf node, in-list? is called on the left branch, which always
takes constant time (since the left branch always has one element). Then,
in-list? is called on the right branch. This list contains (n - [current tree
level]) elements, and the desired element is at the (i - [current tree level])th
position, so this step takes O(i - [current tree level]) time. All the other
operations in encode-symbol are constant time.

So, a call to encode-symbol for the ith symbol takes O(i^2) time: constant +
O(i) = O(i) time at the first level, constant + O(i-1) = O(i), and so on down to
the final recursive step, which is constant time.

So, encoding the most frequent symbol is O(1), while encoding the least frequent
is O(n^2). Note that this does not change the running time for encoding the
whole message, which is:

O(2^n + 4*2^(n-1) + 9*2^(n-2) + 16*2^(n-3) + 25*2^(n-4) + 36*2^(n-5) + ...)
= O(2^n * SUM_{1-n}(i^2/2^i))
= O(2^n * SUM_{1->n}(i^2/2^i))

We can prove that SUM_{1->n}(i^2/2^i) is convergent using the ratio test:

((i+1)^2 / 2^(i+1)) / (i^2 / 2^i))
= (1/2) (i+1)^2/i^2
= (1/2) (i^2 + 2i + 1)/i^2
= (1/2) (1 + 2/i + 1/i^2)

Which approaches 1/2 as i approaches infinity, proving the series is
convergent. Thus, the running time is O(2^n) for encoding a complete message.
