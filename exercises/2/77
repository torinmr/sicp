This works because the real-part, imag-part, magnitude, and angle functions have
previously been defined to work on both varieties of complex numbers by
dispatching on the "polar" or "rectangular" tag. The only thing that needs to be
done to make them available in the new arithmetic system is to register them
under the tag "complex".

Here's an example: Take (magnitude z), where z is '(complex (rectangular (3
4))).

(magnitude z)
=> (apply-generic 'magnitude '(complex (rectangular (3 4)))
=> (magnitude (rectangular (3 4)))
=> (apply-generic 'magnitude '(rectangular (3 4)))
=> (sqrt (+ (square (real-part '(3 4)))
            (square (imag-part '(3 4)))))
=> 5

Thus, apply-generic is invoked twice, the first time invoking the magnitude
procedure in global scope, the second time invoking the magnitude procedure
inside the rectangular package.
