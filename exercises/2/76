The generic operations with explicit dispatch approach can be extended with new
operations without modifying existing code, but adding a new data type requires
changing every function currently in existence.

The message passing style can be extended with new data types without modifying
existing code, but adding a new operation requires modifying every data type.

The data directed style is the most flexible of all: new operations and new data
types can both be added without changing any existing code.
