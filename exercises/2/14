(define a (make-center-percent 10 1))
(define b (make-center-percent 20 1))
(define (print a)
  (newline)
  (display (center a))
  (display " ")
  (display (percent a)))

Every time an operation such as A/B or A/A is performed, the percentage
tolerance doubles. So, there is no multiplicative inverse: B * A/A != B.
