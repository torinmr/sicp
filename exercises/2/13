Suppose we have two quantities, a+-at, and b+-bu. Assume that t and u << 100%,
and that all quantities are positive.

The exact interval of their product is:

(a-at)(b-bu) : (a+at)(b+bu)
ab - abt - abu + abtu : ab + abt + abu + abtu

If t and u are very small, we can decide to ignore the abtu factors, as they
will be a factor of 1/(min t u) smaller than the other terms.

ab - abt - abu : ab + abt + abu

Thus, the result is approximated by ab +- ab(t + u). In other words, the
percentage tolerance of the product is approximately the sum of the percentage
tolerances of the operands.
