She is correct. The rules for combining intervals always compute the "worst
case" scenario, assuming that either operand can take on any value in its range
to determine the smallest and largest possible values of the result. However, if
two operands represent the same measurement, then they can't take on any
combination of values - they must of course take on the same value.

For example, the upper bound of A/B (for positive numbers) is (upper A) / (lower
B). But of course if A and B are the same measurement, the upper and lower bound
must both be one.
