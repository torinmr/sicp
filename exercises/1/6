The new-if will cause an infinite loop: it will try to evaluate the second
argument before calling the function. The second argument has a new-if
statement, so its second argument will be evaluated, and so forth.

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-cause)
        (cond (predicate then-clause)
              (else else-clause)))

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
        (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
                guess
                (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                           x)))
