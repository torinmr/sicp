If applicative order is used, (p) will be evaluated before calling the test
procedure. This will cause an infinite loop, since (p) evaluates to itself.

If normal order is used, "(p)" will be substituted into the test function, which
when evaluated will short circuit and not evaluate (p), so it will return 0.
